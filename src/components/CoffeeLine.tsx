/**
 * The one place the app mentions that it costs its author something.
 *
 * It is a line, not a card, not a banner and not a dialog: nothing about it
 * interrupts, nothing has to be dismissed, and it says the same thing every
 * time rather than escalating. It is put at the end of things that have just
 * finished — a review you have completed, a board you have read to the bottom
 * — because that is where a line about the app is a footnote rather than an
 * interruption, and it never appears in the middle of work.
 *
 * What it does not do is count: no "you have used this 30 times", no growing
 * insistence, nothing triggered by a milestone. The app is free, and the line
 * says so; what follows is an offer, not a request.
