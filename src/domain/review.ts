 * A review is a pass over the things a week quietly accumulates.

 * It invents no new data. Every question it asks is answered from tasks,
 * projects and completions that already exist, which means a review can be
 * abandoned halfway through and has cost nothing, and that nothing it writes
 * back would look unusual in Todoist afterwards. There is no per-project
 * review interval here for that reason: it would have to be stored somewhere,
 * and there is nowhere to store it that Todoist would recognise.
 *
 * The daily pass asks what today is, and takes a few minutes. The weekly pass
 * closes the week that has ended and opens the one starting, in that order and
 * in two named halves, because those are two different frames of mind and a
 * pass that mixes them is one people abandon in the middle.
